    "# The Bash Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "When conducting data science (or programming in general), itâ€™s helpful to get orientated with the command line, or bash shell. On mac computers, this is the terminal application. The command line serves as a low-level interpreter through which you, the user, can send commands directly to the computer. As a computer user, you previously have probably sent commands to the computer through a graphical user interface (GUI) such as a web browser, text editor, photo editor, or any other of the myriad of computer programs now in existence. While the command line is initially daunting with its cryptic looking text, we will quickly see some of the many advantages it can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Open up a bash shell\n",
    "* Check the current working directory with pwd\n",
    "* List files in the current directory using ls\n",
    "* Make directories using mkdir\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shells\n",
    "To start, open up your shell program. For mac, this is the terminal, and for Windows we recommend git bash. Note that the \"command prompt\" on Windows make look similar but is actually another language.\n",

    "## Windows\n",

    "\n",
    "## Workflow Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "When going back and forth between this lesson and your shell, it is useful to either use split screen or to know the shortcuts to switch between applications on your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcuts to change programs/applications:\n",
    "* Mac: (cmd+tab)\n",
    "* Windows: (alt+tab)\n",
    "\n",
    "## pwd\n",
    "The first command to try out is **pwd** which stands for **print working directory**. This will tell you where you currently are in the computer's directory structure. Try it out in terminal or git bash.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## cd\n",
    "The next essential command is **cd** which stands for **change directory**. This allows you to navigate to different folders on your computer's hard drive. Typing cd by itself will automatically take you to your home directory. Typing cd and a folder name will take you to that folder. Typing cd .. will move you one folder up in the hierarchy. Play around and trying moving around folders for a minute or two.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tab completion\n",
    "An extraordinarily useful feature when working on the command line is tab completion. This allows you to hit the tab button to autocomplete names once you have made a unique specification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you navigate to your root directory by running the command **cd**, you will probably have 2 folders within your root directory named \"Downloads\" and \"Documents\" (these are standard folder names created by default in most systems, although you may have renamed them, or your system may be different). With these or longer folder names, it can sometimes become cumbersome to type the full folder name. instead, you can start typing the command and folder name such as **\"cd Dow\"** and then press **tab** to autocomplete. Like magic, the command line should complete the statement correctly to be **cd Downloads**. (Note: this will not work if you have another folder that begins with \"Dow\". Similarly, if you just typed **cd D** or **cd Do** followed by **tab**, the command line will not autocomplete, as the selection is not unique, because **D** or **Do** could both refer to either **Documents** or **Downloads**. Also note that these commands are case sensitive, and folder capitalization much be matched exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ls\n",
    "Continuing with navigating the computer's hard drive, it's useful to know how to **list files**. This is done with the **ls** command, short for list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass optional parameters to ls such as **ls -a** which list **all files** (including hidden files), **ls -l** which will give a **long listing** of files (including file size and last edit times) or you can pass multiple parameters simultaneously such as **ls -al** to produce a detailed listing of all files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## * the wildcard parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "Also very useful is the wildcard parameter. For example, if you wanted to list all files in the current working directory that begin with a, you could type **ls a***. Here, the asterix (*) denotes anything is allowed following the a. Similarly, to list all pdf files in the current working directory we could type **ls *.pdf**, or to list all text files, we could type **ls .txt**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## mkdir\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as you continue to navigate the file directory from the command line it can be useful to be able to create new folders. To do this, use the **mkdir** command, which stands for **make directory**. Try it out with **mkdir NewFolderName**. Afterward, use the **ls** command to see that there is indeed a new folder, and if you wish, move into the new folder using the **cd** command.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we looked at some basic bash commands in order to navigate through files and folders on your computer. From here, we're ready to get started with git, an important version control system used by many programmers, developers and data scientists.\n"
